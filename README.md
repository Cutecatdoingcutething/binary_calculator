# binary_calculator
Binary Calculator is the project works on FPGA (on 7-segments display) by coding with VHDL.

# What it can do?
It has basic functions about calculation
1. Full Adder
2. Subtractor
3. Multiplication
4. Divider (With Remainder)
5. Reset function

# Procedure
This Binary Calculator works by state with 7 states
State S1 : FPGA display 7-segment as start state that let you know it's begin state
State S2 : Input A (Signed Binary)
State S3 : Store A in memory
State S4 : Input B (Signed Binary)
State S5 : Store B in memory
State S6 : Select Operator to calculate (+ - * /)
State S7 : Display result on 7-segments with decimal
